              The Dr. Kobros certifications have become an industry-wide
              standard and a measure of distinction that employers use to
              evaluate prospective employees. Stand out from the crowd by
              getting certified with the Foundation!
            </p>

              Sponsored by the Dr. Kobros Foundation and developed according to
              Norwegian National Standards Institute (NNSI) standards, The Dr.
              Kobros certification programs are designed to test a candidateâ€™s
              level of knowledge without prejudice. The tests use a set of
              testing questions that reflect real-world scenarios, including
              knowledge in many areas ranging from basics to the more complex
              topics.

              made up of thought leaders in the global community. Because the
              exams are created with specific skills, knowledge and competencies
              that are matched to real-world job functions, our certifications
              provide a measure of distinction that employers use to evaluate
              prospective employees.
